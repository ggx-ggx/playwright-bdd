# FAQ

### Why is test files generation needed?
Generating Playwright test files from BDD scenarios allows you to use all Playwright tooling out-of-box:

  * Run a single test with [VS Code extension](guides/ide-integration.md#vs-code)
  * Debug and set breakpoints on specific BDD steps
  * Use `--ui` mode to watch changes 
  * Do everything you can with regular Playwright tests

Moreover, it provides more transparency on how Playwright **sees** your BDD scenarios.

Initially, Playwright-BDD tried to run BDD tests on-the-fly, within `npx playwright test` command. However, several issues appeared:

1. Too many re-generation, because the Playwright config is executed many times from different sources: workers, VS Code extension, UI mode, etc.
2. Implementing watch mode is tricky.
3. Watching files in `--ui` mode leads to a circular dependency: a change in test files triggers a test run, which re-imports the config and triggers another change in test files.

For now, decoupling **test generation** from **test execution** proves to be a better option.

### Can I manually apply `test.use()` in a generated file?
No. Test files generation is fully automated without manual edits. Instead of using `test.use`, which affects all tests in a file, you can [utilize tags](writing-steps/bdd-fixtures.md#tags) and custom fixtures. This approach is more flexible and allows for selectively changing settings for specific scenarios or tests.

### How can I make BDD valuable for my project?
The main point â€” **BDD is a collaboration technique**.

Write BDD examples together with your team during calls and discussions. Use it as a framework to clarify requirements between business, QA, and developers. It should help you get everybody on the same page instead of going back and forth in endless meetings.
